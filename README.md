# AetherionPrime OS

AetherionPrime is a self-evolving, multi-agent AI operating system with:
- Dynamic memory graph for entity tracking
- Plugin architecture for custom agents
- Extensible AgentBus and Kernel orchestrator

## Quickstart

Build the Docker image:
\`\`\`bash
docker build -t aetherionprime:latest .
\`\`\`

Run the AI OS:
\`\`\`bash
docker run --rm aetherionprime:latest
\`\`\`

## Futuristic Vision & Apple Research Insights

### What makes A truly Futuristic AI OS?
- **Self-evolving architecture:** Agents that onboard new capabilities at runtime, rewrite their own logic, and optimize the graph autonomously.  
- **Multi-modal memory graph:** Integrate perceptual data (audio, vision) as graph nodes so the OS “remembers” faces, sounds, and documents.  
- **Secure enclave & trust fabric:** Hardware-backed isolation for critical agents plus verifiable provenance of every state change.  
- **Distributed consensus layer:** Multiple kernel instances across devices or the cloud reach agreement on global state, enabling seamless offline/online operation.  
- **Unified natural-language & code interface:** The CLI/REPL agent evolves into a conversational interface that writes, debugs, and deploys new agents on demand.

### On the Limits of Current AI Engines
Apple’s paper **“The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models via the Lens of Problem Complexity”** demonstrates that even advanced reasoning models break down on tasks as complexity grows (e.g. Tower of Hanoi sequences), revealing they are pattern-matchers rather than true reasoners. This insight guides AetherionPrime’s design as a **system of systems**, combining specialized agents with symbolic and statistical components, rather than relying on a single monolithic LLM.
